    {"id":"44","review_text":"Hi Felix nice to meet you I am Constantinos Senior Developer for Company We are trying to integrate your platform in our system for one of our clients yes I need information on how to get the company-uuid and queue-uuid to setup the CDN ok so the chat-widget will generate the code in the end of the wizard? we need chat voice and screen share though not only chat is there a wizard for all three? I guess we can use script generator for this right? deadline is strict so I dont think they will wait until then the callback functions are the same though? only the initialization is different? I think this week hmm ok so the chat widget  once you start the chat you can then escalate to voice/share yet from the script generator you can also start with voice/share without having to chat first is that correct? How do we call/share? from inside the widget? Screenshot 2021-09-20 125041.png from where? or do you request a call from the agent? so its not available in the new scripts yet where can we ask any developer related questions? May I ask a question from here now? I tried to embed the plugin but it seems that there is a javascript error please see screenshot Screenshot 2021-09-20 130255.png e.map is not a function its local I can share my screen if possible could it be the jquery version we are using or any missing cdns that we need to add? ok thanks please let me know as soon as possible thanks a lot it seems that the CDNs are not loaded properly","sentiment_ntlk":"Positive","sentiment_flair":"NEGATIVE","sentiment_bert":"NEGATIVE","topic":"thank (0.03) good (0.02) think (0.02)","chat_record_id":"1015028"},
